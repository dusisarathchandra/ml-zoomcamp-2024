# Module 1

## Notes:

#### 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
- Machine learning is a process of extracting patterns from data
- Data is of two types.
    1. Features
    2. Target
- Information we know is called `features`, what we want to predict is called `target`
- `Features + Target` combination of both is used to train a model. Model encapsulates all the patterns that it finds from the data ingested to it
- We use the model to predict the data which is basically depicted as 
    `(Features + Model) ---> Predictions`


#### 2. ML vs Rule based systems
- Rule based system works better if the requirements are less complex
- As and when the new rules get added to predict an outcome, the complexity gets increased
- Machine learning outperforms rule based system if the prediction is dependent on multiple rules
- In ML, we basically start with rules and then use these rules as features.
- Example: the course talks about spam detection wherein, if the number of rules increases to detect a spam message like
    1. Domain name starts with `onlinetest.com`, `test.com`
    2. email body has `deposit` in it
    3. email subject length is greater than 20 words
    4. email subject looks suspicious - `you won a lottery`

   Rule based system makes the code complex where as an ML system just looks for patterns by marking each rule to either 1/0, making it easy to form a pattern for later use.

#### 3. Supervised Machine Learning
- Discussed about feature matrix (referred as <font size="6">`X`</font>) & target vector (referred as <font size="6">`y`</font>). 
- In the discussed example - Feature matrix is a 2D matrix with rows as observations, columns as features.
```
                [
 (observations) --> [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] 
                --> [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1] 
                    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] 
                    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
                     â†‘ (features)
                ]
```
- 2D matrix above is treated as feature matrix <span style="font-size: 2em;">X</span>.

- Different types of Supervised Learning
    1. Regression (typically the output would be a number)
    2. Classification (typically outputs a category ex: car, spam example)
    3. Multiclass classification (images of cars, animals, etc)
    4. Binary (Special class of classification where the output is a binary. ex: spam or not)
    5. Ranking (Usually used in recommender systems to rank something)
