# Module 1

## Notes:

#### 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
- Machine learning is a process of extracting patterns from data
- Data is of two types.
    1. Features
    2. Target
- Information we know is called `features`, what we want to predict is called `target`
- `Features + Target` combination of both is used to train a model. Model encapsulates all the patterns that it finds from the data ingested to it
- We use the model to predict the data which is basically depicted as 
    `(Features + Model) ---> Predictions`
